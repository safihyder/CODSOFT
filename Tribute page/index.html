                <h1>Overview</h1>
                <hr>

                <p>Albert Einstein (/ˈaɪnstaɪn/ EYEN-styne;[4] German: [ˈalbɛɐt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn] ⓘ; 14 March 1879 – 18 April
                    1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who is widely held to be one of the greatest and most
                    influential scientists of all time. Best known for developing the theory of relativity, Einstein
                    also made important contributions to quantum mechanics, and was thus a central figure in the
                    revolutionary reshaping of the scientific understanding of nature that modern physics accomplished
                    in the first decades of the twentieth century.[1][5] His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2,
                    which arises from relativity theory, has been called "the world's most famous equation".[6] He
                    received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially
                    for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect",[7] a pivotal step in the development of
                    quantum theory. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.[8][9] In a
                    1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World, Einstein was
                    ranked the greatest physicist of all time.[10] His intellectual achievements and originality have
                    made the word Einstein broadly synonymous with genius <br>Born in the German Empire, Einstein moved
                    to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship (as a subject of the Kingdom of
                    Württemberg)[note 1] the following year. In 1897, at the age of seventeen, he enrolled in the
                    mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss federal polytechnic school in Zürich,
                    graduating in 1900. In 1901, he acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept for the rest of his life.
                    In 1903, he secured a permanent position at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern. In 1905, he submitted a
                    successful PhD dissertation to the University of Zurich. In 1914, he moved to Berlin in order to
                    join the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the Humboldt University of Berlin. In 1917, he became
                    director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics; he also became a German citizen again, this
                    time as a subject of the Kingdom of Prussia.[note 1] <br>In 1933, while he was visiting the United
                    States, Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. Horrified by the Nazi "war of extermination" against
                    his fellow Jews,[12] Einstein decided to remain in the US, and was granted American citizenship in
                    1940.[13] On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt
                    alerting him to the potential German nuclear weapons program and recommending that the US begin
                    similar research. Einstein supported the Allies but generally viewed the idea of nuclear weapons
                    with great dismay.[14]</p>

                <h1>Life and career</h1>
                <hr>

                <p>Albert Einstein was born in Ulm,[19] in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire, on 14 March
                    1879.[20][21] His parents, secular Ashkenazi Jews, were Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer,
                    and Pauline Koch. In 1880, the family moved to Munich's borough of Ludwigsvorstadt-Isarvorstadt,
                    where Einstein's father and his uncle Jakob founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, a
                    company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current.[19]

                    Albert attended a Catholic elementary school in Munich from the age of five. When he was eight, he
                    was transferred to the Luitpold Gymnasium (now known as the Albert-Einstein-Gymnasium (Munich) [de])
                    where he received advanced primary and then secondary school education.[22]

                    In 1894, Hermann and Jakob's company tendered for a contract to install electric lighting in Munich,
                    but without success—they lacked the capital that would have been required to update their technology
                    from direct current to the more efficient, alternating current alternative.[23] The failure of their
                    bid forced them to sell their Munich factory and search for new opportunities elsewhere. The
                    Einstein family moved to Italy, first to Milan and a few months later to Pavia, where they settled
                    in Palazzo Cornazzani.[24] Einstein, then fifteen, stayed behind in Munich in order to finish his
                    schooling. His father wanted him to study electrical engineering, but he was a fractious pupil who
                    found the Gymnasium's regimen and teaching methods far from congenial. He later wrote that the
                    school's policy of strict rote learning was harmful to creativity. At the end of December 1894, a
                    letter from a doctor persuaded the Luitpold's authorities to release him from its care, and he
                    joined his family in Pavia.[25] While in Italy as a teenager, he wrote an essay entitled "On the
                    Investigation of the State of the Ether in a Magnetic Field".[26][27]

                    Einstein excelled at physics and mathematics from an early age, and soon acquired the mathematical
                    expertise normally only found in a child several years his senior. He began teaching himself
                    algebra, calculus and Euclidean geometry when he was twelve; he made such rapid progress that he
                    discovered an original proof of the Pythagorean theorem before his thirteenth birthday.[28][29][30]
                    A family tutor, Max Talmud, said that only a short time after he had given the twelve year old
                    Einstein a geometry textbook, the boy "had worked through the whole book. He thereupon devoted
                    himself to higher mathematics ... Soon the flight of his mathematical genius was so high I could not
                    follow."[31] Einstein recorded that he had "mastered integral and differential calculus" while still
                    just fourteen.[29] His love of algebra and geometry was so great that at twelve, he was already
                    confident that nature could be understood as a "mathematical structure".[31]</p>

                <h1>Scientific career</h1>
                <hr>

                <p>Throughout his life, Einstein published hundreds of books and articles.[19][214] He published more
                    than 300 scientific papers and 150 non-scientific ones.[16][214] On 5 December 2014, universities
                    and archives announced the release of Einstein's papers, comprising more than 30,000 unique
                    documents.[215][216] Einstein's intellectual achievements and originality have made the word
                    "Einstein" synonymous with "genius".[11] In addition to the work he did by himself he also
                    collaborated with other scientists on additional projects including the Bose–Einstein statistics,
                    the Einstein refrigerator and others.[217][218] <br>
                    Thermodynamic fluctuations and statistical physics
                    Main articles: Statistical mechanics, thermal fluctuations, and statistical physics
                    Einstein's first paper[78][227] submitted in 1900 to Annalen der Physik was on capillary attraction.
                    It was published in 1901 with the title "Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen", which
                    translates as "Conclusions from the capillarity phenomena". Two papers he published in 1902–1903
                    (thermodynamics) attempted to interpret atomic phenomena from a statistical point of view. These
                    papers were the foundation for the 1905 paper on Brownian motion, which showed that Brownian
                    movement can be construed as firm evidence that molecules exist. His research in 1903 and 1904 was
                    mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena.[227]
                    <br>Theory of critical opalescence
                    Main article: Critical opalescence
                    Einstein returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density
                    variations in a fluid at its critical point. Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by
                    the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. At the critical point, this
                    derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations. The effect of density fluctuations is that light
                    of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. Einstein relates this to
                    Rayleigh scattering, which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the
                    wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue.[228] Einstein quantitatively derived critical
                    opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and demonstrated how both the effect and
                    Rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter.

                <h1>Non-scientific legacy</h1>
                <hr>

                <p>While traveling, Einstein wrote daily to his wife Elsa and adopted stepdaughters Margot and Ilse. The
                    letters were included in the papers bequeathed to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Margot
                    Einstein permitted the personal letters to be made available to the public, but requested that it
                    not be done until twenty years after her death (she died in 1986[306]). Barbara Wolff, of the Hebrew
                    University's Albert Einstein Archives, told the BBC that there are about 3,500 pages of private
                    correspondence written between 1912 and 1955.[307]

                    Einstein's right of publicity was litigated in 2015 in a federal district court in California.
                    Although the court initially held that the right had expired,[308] that ruling was immediately
                    appealed, and the decision was later vacated in its entirety. The underlying claims between the
                    parties in that lawsuit were ultimately settled. The right is enforceable, and the Hebrew University
                    of Jerusalem is the exclusive representative of that right.[309] Corbis, successor to The Roger
                    Richman Agency, licenses the use of his name and associated imagery, as agent for the
                    university.[310] <br>
                    Einstein became one of the most famous scientific celebrities after the confirmation of his general
                    theory of relativity in 1919.[312][313][314] Although most of the public had little understanding of
                    his work, he was widely recognized and admired. In the period before World War II, The New Yorker
                    published a vignette in their "The Talk of the Town" feature saying that Einstein was so well known
                    in America that he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain "that theory".
                    Eventually he came to cope with unwanted enquirers by pretending to be someone else: "Pardon me,
                    sorry! Always I am mistaken for Professor Einstein."[315]

                    Einstein has been the subject of or inspiration for many novels, films, plays, and works of
                    music.[316] He is a favorite model for depictions of absent-minded professors; his expressive face
                    and distinctive hairstyle have been widely copied and exaggerated. Time magazine's Frederic Golden
                    wrote that Einstein was "a cartoonist's dream come true".[317]

                    Many popular quotations are often misattributed to him.[318][319] For example, it is often claimed,
                    erroneously, that he said, "The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and
                    expecting different results."[318]</p>

                <p>Main article: List of awards and honors received by Albert Einstein
                    Einstein received numerous awards and honors, and in 1922, he was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in
                    Physics "for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the
                    photoelectric effect". None of the nominations in 1921 met the criteria set by Alfred Nobel, so the
                    1921 prize was carried forward and awarded to Einstein in 1922.[7]

                    Einsteinium, a synthetic chemical element, was named in his honor in 1955, a few months after his
                    death.[320]
